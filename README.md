# Research-Project

In this project I have developed a real-time data acquisition and control system for PicoScope using Python to monitor and optimize solar cell performance, providing real-time feedback and contributing to new instrumentation development. 
I Acquired and analyzed solar cell voltage data under various illumination conditions using Python scripts to control LabJack devices and extract electrical properties.
Performed data analysis and on large quantities of experimental results through Jupyter Notebooks.
